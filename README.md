This repo was made for the first assignment of ATLS 2200: Technology Onboarding.

I'm kinda confused about the packages, but I got the VSCode extensions if those are the same thing? My hobby is arts and crafts. I enjoyed trying many different things. I've had VSCode since my freshman year, so I don't need to redownload it for the 5th time at the moment. Hopefully, it won't break again...
