This repo was made for the first assignment of ATLS 2200: Technology Onboarding.

I'm kinda confused about the packages, but I got the VSCode extensions if those are the same thing? My hobby is arts and crafts. I enjoyed trying many different things. I've had VSCode since my freshman year, so I don't need to redownload it for the 5th time at the moment. Hopefully, it won't break again...

The WA1 and WA2 assignments are in the repository. I have yet to add the pdfs for ICA1 and ICA2.
